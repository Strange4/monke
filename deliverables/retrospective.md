# RETROSPECTIVE

## SPRINT 01 - The Baboon phase

### What went well !! (✿◡‿◡)
  + Great communication within the team.
  + Great response time outside of school hours.
  + Great team spirit, everyone is friendly, no issues with teammates
  + Everyone on top of their tasks, no issue with teammates slacking
  + Great schedule, everything was planned and everyone knew what to do
  
### What did not go well ╰（‵□′）╯
  + Different schedules, people have different availabilities
  + Scared of not achieveing jaya's expectations, of underachieving
  + Code quality could be better
  
## What to change in next sprint ¯\\(°_o)/¯
  + Expectations set should be higher since we ended up finishing too soon
  + More communication between frontend and backend people. 
  + Scrum master on next sprint should be more in charge of who works on what:
	+ scrum master should keep track of who is doing what and how long it's taking
    + implement the scrum master and product owner roles more.
