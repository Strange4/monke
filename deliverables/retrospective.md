# RETROSPECTIVE

## SPRINT 01 - The Baboon phase

### What went well !! (✿◡‿◡)

+ Great communication within the team.
+ Great response time outside of school hours.
+ Great team spirit, everyone is friendly, no issues with teammates
+ Everyone on top of their tasks, no issue with teammates slacking
+ Great schedule, everything was planned and everyone knew what to do

### What did not go well ╰（‵□′）╯

+ Different schedules, people have different availabilities
+ Scared of not achieveing jaya's expectations, of underachieving
+ Code quality could be better

### What to change in next sprint ¯\\(°_o)/¯

+ Expectations set should be higher since we ended up finishing too soon
+ More communication between frontend and backend people.
+ Scrum master on next sprint should be more in charge of who works on what:
  + scrum master should keep track of who is doing what and how long it's taking
  + implement the scrum master and product owner roles more.

## SPRINT 02 - The Macaque phase

### What went well !! (✿◡‿◡)

+ There was a lot more structure as to who was doing which task.
+ A lot of code got cleaned up in this sprint so that it is more reliable, concise, and readable.
+ The website is looking better thanks to everyone's being up to task.
+ Everyone started to participate more in meetings and are a lot more involved than before.

### What did not go well ╰（‵□′）╯

+ Some lack of communication on making changes on others code without correctly informing the owners
  + was resolved after communicating clearly.
+ The rythm slowed down compared to sprint 1 which is normal as this is when many of us started encountering issues and bugs.
+ The separation between frontend and backend people as well as the communication issues related to that were still present.
+ Code quality didn't improve as much as expected. Website has been more likely to crash. Adding new features became more complicated.
  + Code got refactored in order to help fiix this, leading in a reduced amount of crashes.

### What to change in next sprint ¯\\(°_o)/¯

+ Greater communication when it comes to wanting to make changes
  + first communicate with the owners if they can make the changes themselves to the code.
+ Double check the priorities, sometimes extra-time would be spent on a detail that isn't trivial to the product.
+ Having the FrontEnd and BackEnd communicate more.
  + Scrum master should have a greater role in making sure that everyone knows what's happening as well.
+ Put more emphasis and focus on bug fixes and inconsistencies within the app
